To implement **Smart Waste Categorization with AI** in your **EcoWaste** project, here are the best AI options depending on your skill, time, and whether you're deploying on web (Vercel) with browser-side inference:

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended AI Option (Browser-Based - No Backend Needed)

#### üéØ **Google Teachable Machine** + TensorFlow\.js (Best for Vercel)

**Why this?**

* No backend needed ‚Äî runs in browser
* You can train a model by uploading images in Teachable Machine UI
* Export the model and run it using `@tensorflow/tfjs`
* Works perfectly in Vercel with zero backend

---

#### üîß **How it works:**

1. **Train the Model:**

   * Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
   * Select **Image Project**
   * Create classes: `E-waste`, `Dry Waste`, `Reusable`
   * Upload sample images for each class
   * Train and **export** the model (for web)

2. **Integrate in Your App:**

   * Install TensorFlow\.js:

     ```bash
     npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
     ```
   * Load model in your frontend (Next.js client component):

     ```ts
     import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs'
     import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

     const useWasteClassifier = () => {
       const [model, setModel] = useState<tf.GraphModel | null>(null)

       useEffect(() => {
         tf.loadGraphModel('/model/model.json').then(setModel)
       }, [])

       const classify = async (imageElement: HTMLImageElement) => {
         if (!model) return null
         const prediction = await model.predict(tf.browser.fromPixels(imageElement))
         return prediction
       }

       return { classify }
     }
     ```

3. **Upload your exported model** to `/public/model` in your Next.js app.

### üîÅ Alternatives (If Backend Allowed)

If you want **server-side classification** (not recommended for first version on Vercel):

* Use **Hugging Face Model API** (costly + needs API key)
* Use **Replicate** for custom image classification
* Use **Custom TensorFlow Model** with Supabase Edge Functions (advanced)

---

### üí° Recommendation:

Stick to **Teachable Machine + TensorFlow\.js** for:

* Simplicity
* Fast AI integration
* 100% frontend browser-based (no cost)
* Works well on Vercel

---

If you'd like, I can help you:

* Export a sample Teachable Machine model
* Write the code to auto-categorize based on image upload

Would you like me to generate a starter AI integration for this?
