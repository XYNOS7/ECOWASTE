I have an existing EcoWaste web app (Next.js + Supabase) that includes user authentication and features like waste reporting, eco-coins, real-time updates, and map integration.

I now want to add Admin functionality into the same app, with a separate login/signup flow and a protected admin dashboard.

💼 Admin Authentication
Use Supabase Auth for both users and admins.

Store additional role data in a user_type field (e.g. user or admin) in the Supabase users table or in a separate admins table.

🔑 Admin Auth Requirements:
Add /admin-login and /admin-signup pages.

On admin signup:

Register with Supabase Auth.

Set user_type: 'admin' in the database or insert into admins table.

On login:

Check if user_type === 'admin'

If true, redirect to /admin-dashboard

Else, reject login or redirect to user section

🧠 Admin Dashboard (/admin-dashboard)
Display a table/grid of all user-reported waste reports:

Fields: report_id, image, description, location, category, user_id, status, timestamp

🎯 Admin Features:
View reports with filters: pending, waiting, completed

Actions:

✅ Verify (changes status to waiting)

✔️ Complete (changes status to completed)

❌ Delete report

Real-time updates:

Use Supabase Realtime to reflect report status updates instantly on both user and admin sides

Auto-update user dashboard if admin verifies or completes a report

🛠️ Technical Setup
✅ Supabase Tables:
Use existing reports table (add status field if not present)

Optionally create a new admins table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE admins (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email text UNIQUE,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
✅ Auth Check (Middleware or Route Guard):
Use Supabase session to check if logged-in user is admin

Protect /admin-dashboard route:

Redirect non-admins to home or /login

Show admin dashboard only if session user is of type admin

⚡ Bonus Features (Optional):
📍 Location Map preview on reports

🔄 Admin action history (admin_logs table)

🔔 Toast/alert notifications on action complete

🌙 Dark mode toggle for admin

📱 Mobile-friendly dashboard UI

🧪 Prompt Summary for ChatGPT/Replit:
"Enhance my existing EcoWaste web app (Next.js + Supabase) to include:

An /admin-login and /admin-signup page with Supabase Auth.

Admin role check (either in user_type or a new admins table).

After successful login/signup, redirect admin to /admin-dashboard.

On /admin-dashboard, fetch and display all user reports (with status, location, etc.).

Admin can update report status from 'pending' → 'waiting' → 'completed' or delete it.

Use Supabase Realtime to reflect updates instantly for both admin and users.

Keep existing user login, signup, and report system untouched."
